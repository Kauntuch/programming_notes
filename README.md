# General programming notes

This is a general storage repo for storing my text and code notes as I learn various programming languages. 

Languages so far:
- HTML, CSS
- Python
- JavaScript

Other:
- Django
- SQL (SQLite)

Everything originally comes from note apps and code-along courses and tutorials. These notes are originally for my own usage and may not all be edited for general readability. 

Apologies. Though if you are reading this, I do hope you might find something useful. 

Enjoy your stay!
